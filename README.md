### Introduction:
Our project hopes to explain European international soccer match results. Drawing data from friendlies, international competitions, and FIFA rankings, we explore different variables and their effect on the team's performance.

### Navigation:
Our final code is all maintained in `Central.ipynb`. This file contains appended versions of all the other notebooks in this repository formatted and using the same visualization theme. Other miscellaneous csv files contain our projects sources of data. 

### Contribution:
This repository is open to forks, pull requests, or issues. Feel free to further our research or use our cleaned data to explain other interesting ideas.
